# Oh My Prod
A learning application for practicing debugging skills.

## Intent
I'm building a sample web application framework that is designed to have some pretty gnarly bugs. The plan is for developers of all skill levels be able to pull down and run this locally so that they can practice their debugging skills. I'm writing a series of problems that will outline what the "user" is complaining about and then send you off into the code to find out why they're getting the issue and try your hand at fixing the issue.
